                    <h4>Hot Weather Precautions</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wear a hat and sunscreen.</li>
                        <li>Watch for signs of dehydration and drink plenty of water.</li>
                        <li>Retreat to the shade between ends.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Remember, it's sometimes better to sit out in the shade and spectate in very hot weather.

                    <h4>Risks during Storms and Strong Winds</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Never shoot outside as a storm approaches.</li>
                        <li>Do not shelter under trees in windy weather.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Purchasing your First Bow</h4>
                    <p>
                        New members are encouraged not to buy a bow until consulting with a coach. Hire equipment initially and then get measured and discuss options with a coach.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Book in advance with a coach for help with setting up your new bow. Arrows must generally be matched to both the bow and the archerâ€™s draw length.
